# Rogoto Library

Rogoto Library to control a BrickPI as a Logo Turtle built out of Lego Technics.

This library will create parse commands and then tell the Lego Technics what to do.
It allows people to draw items by doing the following:

```
    pendown
    forward 10
    right 90
    forward 10
    right 90
    forward 10
    right 90
    forward 10
    penup
```

The above should put the pendown, draw a square and then lift the pen.
